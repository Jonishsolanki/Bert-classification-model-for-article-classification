The 18th annual Golden Bull Award ceremony was held last Friday 5th November, in the Grand Ballroom at One World Hotel, Petaling Jaya, Selangor.
MFE Formwork Technology was delighted to receive their 2nd Super Golden Bull Award at the ceremony, winning their last one in 2018.
It has been such a trying period for all businesses across the world, coping with the pandemic and it’s really an honour to receive such an award in such a difficult trading year.
This would not have happened without the teamwork, commitment and dedication of the entire MFE Family and we wish to say a special ‘Thank You’ to everyone involved, our staff, our workforce, our valued Clients and our supporters across the world.
Speaking after receiving the award, our COO Pat Gorham said ""This is such an honour to have our company recognised and awarded at such an important event. Especially after such a stressful period with Covid, but we never relaxed, never gave up, we stood by our vision and ensured we maintained our position as the leader in our business sector.""",Awards/Recognition/Achievement
"Awake Asia, a regional e-commerce enabler, has announced that it will be now merging with data and AI company ADA, which will help both of the companies empower their services across 10 markets in Asia Pacific, particularly in the e-commerce sector.
Awake Asia’s integration under the ADA brand is effective 1 June this year, where they will serve the markets of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia, South Korea, and Vietnam.
The merger entails the combination of Awake Asia’s deep e-commerce expertise with ADA’s media, creative, and analytics solutions to drive online sales for brands. This is best applied through digital marketing deeply linked to e-commerce revenue generation; consumer data and analytics leveraged to uplift e-commerce sales; and reaching vast audiences in super-apps and marketplaces.
For Srinivas Gattamneni, chief executive officer of ADA, the merger brings together an integrated approach for brands to reach and convert digital consumers, which is best supported by the fact that more brands are forced to adapt to capture the ‘great migration’ of consumers from offline to online, and business owners still in the dark on how to navigate the challenges to maximize return on investment.
“At ADA, our belief is that e-commerce should not be a siloed execution but needs to be deeply integrated into the brand’s analytics, media, creative, and marketing technology investments – only then can we achieve superior performance,” he said.
Leading the new division is Simon Paterson who joins ADA as chief of e-commerce enablement and the former CEO of Awake Asia. 
Commenting on his new appointment, he said “Over the past 5 years, Awake Asia has built a formidable e-commerce enablement business in Southeast Asia. We are excited to embark on this new phase of growth with integrated analytics, media, and creative to boost e-commerce operations for all brands in the region.”
The merger opens a new market for ADA in Vietnam with over 150 e-commerce specialists currently serving more than 120 brands, driving e-commerce growth for clients such as P&G, Unilever, BMW, and Wyeth; and e-commerce partners including Shopee, Tokopedia, and Lazada among others.
ADA has recently been expanding its data and AI-oriented services across Asia Pacific, such as launching its martech service, an end-to-end e-commerce service, and its partnership with Insider for data-led enterprise marketing endeavors, as well its recent US$60m funding from Softbank.",Merger/Acquisition/Partnership
"Carlsberg Group has been named as recipients of the 2021 Lighthouse Awards for a revolutionary water recycling plant inaugurated in 2021, which will make the Fredericia brewery in Denmark the most water efficient brewery in the world.
The winning Lighthouse organisations, named so because they are shining a light for others to follow, have developed new ways of using technology, finance or partnerships, including circularity in their practice, to reduce their impact in waterstressed regions, or build resilience in their local water systems.
The revolutionary technology at Fredericia Brewery recycles 90% of the process water, and will halve water use from 2.9hl per hl of beer to just 1.4 hl/hl, saving around 500 million litres a year. By processing the water to generate biogas and recirculating hot water, the plant is also expected to cut brewery energy consumption by around 10%. The learnings will support Carlsberg to reach its target to virtually eliminate water waste globally by 2030.
Paul O’Callaghan, Founder of Brave Blue World Foundation, commented: “The Lighthouse Awards honour the pioneers who are embracing water innovation to make tangible changes within their organisation or community. It is also an opportunity for us to raise greater awareness of the remarkable work happening in the global water community. The achievements of our 2021 recipients show us what is possible when bold ambitions are supported and enabled. We are proud to celebrate the stories of these visionaries who are showing us the way to a sustainable water future.”
Victor Shevtsov, EVP Integrated Supply Chain, Carlsberg Group, added: “This award is great recognition for the work of our colleagues, developing a public-private partnership to implement world-first technology at our Fredericia brewery. The learnings we take from this will be key to meeting our target to eliminate water waste everywhere we brew, and I look forward to sharing more on the way towards zero.”
The Lighthouse Awards were launched by the Brave Blue World Foundation in December 2020, following the release of its documentary Brave Blue World, which highlights the urgency of the global water crisis and the pioneers who are building sustainable solutions.",Awards/Recognition/Achievement

"AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” of Labuan Reinsurance (L) Ltd (Labuan Re) (Malaysia). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is negative.
The ratings reflect Labuan Re’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best categorises as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).Labuan Re’s balance sheet strength assessment is underpinned by its risk-adjusted capitalisation that is expected to remain at the strongest level over the medium term, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Positive balance sheet factors include the company’s typically conservative investment portfolio, with a focus on good quality fixed-income securities. Partially offsetting balance sheet factors include Labuan Re’s modest-sized absolute capital base and limited internal capital generation over recent years. In addition, the company remains exposed to natural catastrophe risks emanating from its regional reinsurance operations and through its participation in several Lloyd’s of London syndicates with international exposure, albeit Labuan Re has sought to actively reduce its peak peril exposures over the past few years.
AM Best views Labuan Re’s operating performance as adequate, albeit the continued negative outlook for the FSR and Long-Term ICR reflects pressure on this assessment. Over recent years, the company’s underwriting performance has been impacted adversely by a series of global catastrophe events and from an increased frequency of large losses on its domestic property portfolio. The company’s combined ratio was 109.3% in 2019, with a five-year average of 106.4% (2015-2019). During the first nine months of 2020, Labuan Re continued to report an underwriting loss driven by a combination of catastrophe losses and provisioning related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investment operations over a number of years have aided to offset technical losses partially, with a five-year average net investment yield of over 2% (2015-2019). Prospectively, AM Best expects Labuan Re to continue to execute remedial actions, which are aimed at enabling technical and operating profitability over the near term. AM Best does, however, continue to note that challenges remain in executing on this business plan given a persisting competitive operating environment.
AM Best assesses Labuan Re’s business profile as neutral given its position as a well-established regional non-life reinsurer. In addition, the company’s business profile continues to benefit from portfolio diversification emanating from its participation as a corporate member in several Lloyd’s of London syndicates. Over the medium term, AM Best expects the company to exhibit a declining trend in gross written premium, as it continues to embark on a voluntary retrenchment of unprofitable business and scale back its participation in Lloyd’s of London syndicates.
AM Best views the company’s ERM approach as appropriate given the current size and complexity of its operations. Labuan Re continues to develop its technical pricing and risk selection capabilities as part of its remedial actions aimed at improving its prospective underwriting performance.",Awards/Recognition/Achievement

"Compass Minerals (NYSE: CMP), a leading global provider of essential minerals, today announced a $45 million equity investment in FORTRESS North America (Fortress), an early-stage long-term fire retardant (LTR) company dedicated to developing and producing a portfolio of more environmentally friendly and carbon neutral fire retardants to combat the devastating effects of wildfires in North America and around the world. This builds upon the initial $5 million Series A investment Compass Minerals made in Fortress, meaningfully increasing its minority equity stake ownership to approximately 45%, with the opportunity to further increase that stake over time.
Fortress is a next-generation fire retardant company focused on reinventing wildfire application technologies. Led by CEO Robert Burnham alongside a team of multi-disciplined, veteran fire professionals, Fortress is the first new company in more than 20 years to pass all testing protocols and certifications for qualifying two new LTR products. LTRs are highly specialized formulations designed specifically for aerial drops to control the spread of wildfires. Fortress’ latest FR-600 ground retardant was recently added to the United States Forest Service’s (USFS) Qualified Products List.
Fortress’ patent portfolio of LTR and ground retardant formulations has been developed primarily using essential minerals supplied from Compass Minerals’ solar evaporation site on the Great Salt Lake near Ogden, Utah, which was the foundation of the strategic alliance between the two companies.
“Since we began working closely with the entrepreneurial Fortress team approximately 18 months ago, we have been excited about the growth potential of their innovative products in what has historically been a stagnant and sole-sourced market,” said Kevin S. Crutchfield, Compass Minerals president and CEO. “We believe our support, both financially and operationally, will help accelerate that growth potential, and we anticipate Fortress’ high demand season will help to counter-balance the seasonality of our core deicing salt business.”
The USFS tests fire chemicals for safety and efficacy prior to approval for field use. The combustion retarding effectiveness test (burn test) is one of the most critical, as it assesses a new product’s ability to retard the spread of fire against the legacy chemistry of ammonium phosphate. The USFS burn test conducted for the Fortress FR-100 product showed that it performed 20-30% better than ammonium phosphate products typically in use today. Fortress’ LTRs, based on magnesium chloride technology, are also designed to deliver extended effectiveness by re-hydrating when the relative humidity rises above approximately 33%, a common occurrence overnight on many large wildfires.
Fortress plans to further expand its suite of magnesium chloride-based retardants, which provide unique properties for fighting wildfires and abating fire risk. The announced investment by Compass Minerals is expected to enable Fortress to scale more quickly by completing the construction of its manufacturing facilities for both its powder and liquid concentrate products. Fortress also expects to leverage Compass Minerals’ supply chain and logistics capabilities in support of Fortress’ market competitiveness.
“Nothing about our alliance with Compass Minerals is happenstance,” said Burnham. “The alignment of capabilities were crystal clear from our very first meeting, and taking this step now allows us to scale rapidly and effectively.”",Fund Raise/Investment

"Climate change affects all. Without us even realising, the uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gases has its consequences closer to home. 

The planet’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. It is projected Earth will be 4 degrees Celsius warmer by 2100. 

Being a maritime nation, Malaysia is prone to the drastic coastline change brought upon by the warming of ocean and shrinking ice sheets, which lead to sea level rise. A projection by National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) indicated that Malaysia will experience a sea level rise between 0.25 metre to 1.06 metre in various regions by the year 2100 if the situation remains unchecked. 

Peninsular Malaysia will experience a sea level rise between 0.25 metre to 0.52 metre, with Kelantan and Kedah being the worst hit states. The situation is even grimmer in Sabah and Sarawak as both states will have to deal with a sea level rise between 0.43 metre to 1.06 metre, with north and east coasts of Sabah to bear the brunt. 
A small increase in sea level can have devastating effects, causing destructive erosion, flooding, soil contamination and loss of habitat. On a larger scale, the consequences to the ecosystem and the socioeconomic aspects of local inhabitants are unimaginable. 

According to a study, about 10% to 12% of total global anthropogenic, or man-made, greenhouse gas emission is from agriculture sector. Such emission is produced through operation during oil palm growing and processing as well as from change in carbon stock. Diesel consumption in agricultural machinery, usage of fertilisers and wastewater from estates are some of the agricultural operational activities that contributed to the statistics. 

In combating the effects of climate change, Boustead Plantations Berhad has taken several key reforms throughout the years to minimise greenhouse gases emissions from estates and mills. To improve carbon sequestration, we have increased our conservation areas and river buffer zones, a move which has and will continue to be implemented by all estates. Further reduction of emissions is made through the construction of biogas plants to capture methane. 

From 2019 to 2020, we have managed to reduce our greenhouse gases emissions, particularly from our palm oil mill effluent, fuel consumption and emissions from peat. Nevertheless, we believe we can do better for the environment. As we move towards becoming a sustainable plantation company, our target is to explore and find better avenues to radically diminish our operational impact towards the environment.",Product/Service Launch

"11 tips for working with the Facebook algorithm
Reply to your audience
Aim for love more than likes
Post when your audience is online Tend to your branded Facebook Group 
The advantage of running a business Facebook Group is that, while it does take some care and feeding, it opens another channel for you to connect with your customers, fans, and community. 
It’s also a second channel for important content to reach your audience’s eyes. The Facebook algorithm prioritizes posts from Groups users care about, so a post that gets amplified in a popular Group by enthusiasts and fans is likelier to earn more reach.
Recency is a key signal. The newest posts go to the top of the news feed.

"Boathouse supports #BlackLivesMatter. We’re committed to do what we can, as a company and as individuals, to combat racism and systemic inequality. It’s the right thing to do. 
Talking about race, injustice, bigotry, hidden biases—basically everything we will need to address if we are to succeed in Boathouse’s ambitious endeavor—is excruciatingly difficult and fraught with emotion. It will not be easy. At the risk of oversimplification, we will need to adhere to one of our founding mantras with all our strength: “Humbly cutting through the bullshit.” We will need to plumb new depths of humility; to admit what we don’t know; to listen, learn and change; to accept that even the most well-intentioned of us just might be wrong. And we will need to cut through centuries of societal, cultural and institutional bullshit.
Every organization has its strengths. We use data, intelligence and creativity to solve business problems. We look at ways we can serve organizations and generate a return on investment. At a fundamental level, we learn. Our goal is to use these same skills—learning and doing—to fight injustice and inequality. Because we can do better. And we can always do more. 
The pressing need for change is evident. In what way, or ways, can we make a difference? How can we begin to reverse the systemic inequality that’spervaded the world? These are the questions we’re asking ourselves. We started with a small group in our agency, and have opened up these questions to evyone. 
This resulted in a range of ideas: from smaller-scale changes internally, such as the way we hire, the vendors we use, and the conversations we have, to the external ways that can make an impact. Now it’s up to us to focus on a few of these ideas, and really give them our all. 
One insight to consider: change is iterative. The corporate world needs to invest in actions that have a reverberating effect. This goes beyond giving money to fill gaps. 
It’s about making intentional decisions on how to use funds to create an impact that, in turn, creates more impact. It’s a multiplier effect.
We can use investments and information to help create this change. To create opportunities where there haven’t been any before. To hear voices that have gone unheard. 
To succeed we will need to push ourselves and each other. We will need to challenge and push understandings. And we will need to open our minds, devoting our time and mental energy. 
This is just the start. And there is no end, no finish line. This work is never-ending and requires an ongoing commitment. And we are resolutely committed.",Fund Raise/Investment

"PETRONAS Lubricants International (PLI) today announces the launch of its new PETRONAS Urania oil range, engineered with core strength for both light commercial and heavy duty trucks. With new Strong Tech™ technology, PETRONAS Urania delivers the durability needed to withstand the toughest situations across EMEA.

Urania Green product range

Facing extreme engine temperatures, oxidation and damaging deposits, PETRONAS Urania brings core strength to the trucks and commercial vehicles that must survive in the harshest conditions under the heaviest loads. From extreme weather to higher demand to restock store shelves quickly, every innovation has been tailored to maximise performance across all major vehicle brands. Through its unique formula this new range of high-quality Engine Oils extends drain intervals, minimises wear, reduces unplanned downtime and ultimately ensures complete operational flexibility.

Developed with StrongTech™ technology at the PLI Global Research & Technology Centre in Turin, Italy, the new formula enables vehicles to stay stronger for longer as the oil forms a uniquely strong fluid film. Incredibly robust molecule chains lock away soot to maintain optimal viscosity and defend against wear and oxidation, extending the oil’s efficiency right up to the next drain. PETRONAS Urania is designed to increase an engines life under pressure, so it can continue to inspire confidence in fleet managers, and reduce the threats faced by those who earn a living behind the wheel.

The profitability that comes with staying on the road and maximising the vehicle’s capabilities is thanks to 20 years of PLI experience in improving fuel efficiency and reducing the total cost of ownership. In addition, the support services PLI provides to its customers further enable users to get the best from their PETRONAS Urania lubricants. Only with the smartest technologies and best support can drivers have the sheer confidence in their truck to get the job done on time and within budget.

These decades of experience and extensive research have produced a better fuel economy, reduced emissions, enhanced reliability and extreme durability. PETRONAS Urania has been engineered with CO2 reduction in mind, so drivers can maximise uptime without compromising on sustainability. For example, the new PETRONAS Urania 5000 5W-30 (which 5000 5w30)maintains a much thinner film compared to conventional 5W-30 engine oils, significantly reducing fuel consumption and harmful emissions. Altogether, PETRONAS Urania with Strong Tech is the range that meets the strictest international standards for quality and environmental impact.

By keeping vehicles on the road for longer, fleet managers and their drivers can not only meet tough regulations for sustainable mobility, but also stay at the forefront of fleet management in the long term.",Product/Service Launch

"Sporting Kansas City announced on Friday an expanded First Team partnership with Compass Minerals to become the club’s first sleeve sponsor. The Compass Minerals logo will be prominently displayed as a patch on the right sleeve of Sporting’s primary and secondary jerseys as part of the multi-year partnership, which also includes naming rights to Pinnacle National Development Center and Wyandotte Sporting Fields.

"Mostly, people don’t change jobs solely for money. They almost never resign on a whim or in a fit of anger. They joined your company because they believed its right for them, and they actually want it to be right.

Something, at some point, makes it wrong. And if you really take the time to dig into their real reasons for leaving — and you should — you will find that it’s not “the company” they blame. It’s not the location, or the team, or the database or the air-conditioning.

It’s the leadership!

So, next time you get a resignation, resist the temptation to laugh it off as “another dumbo who doesn’t get us.” It’s not the departing employee who doesn’t “get it.” It’s not the company they are leaving; it’s the leadership.

"In Malaysia, the Chinese descendants of the Hainanese dialect group (my grandparents are from Hainan, China) have traditionally been coffee shop operators or chefs. In fact, my paternal grandfather owned quite a famous coffee shop in Batu Pahat, Johor years ago. The Hainan dialect group in Malaysia is also known for the Hainanese Chicken Rice. Today for International Accounting Day, we decided to serve Coffee in the office, turning our office into a temporary “Hainan” coffee shop. As an accountant by day and a want-to-be chef by night, I imagined that maybe I will have my own Coffee Shop serving fusion Hainanese cuisine!!",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"The key to successful leadership is INFLUENCE, not Authority.
Leaders become great not because of their power…
Because of their ability to empower others!\
A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way!
Great leaders don’t set out to be a leader…
They set out to make a difference!
It’s never about the role, always about the goal!
Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.
True leaders always practice the three R’s:
Respect for others, Respect for self, and responsibility for all their actions!
The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things.
Instead, the leader is the one that gets the people to the greatest things!
The best leaders have a high consideration factor,
They really care about their people!
Great leaders don’t tell you what to do… they show you!

It also allows me to encourage my fellow students to do the same. Given the amazing opportunities we are offered at Kambala, I think it’s important for students to understand how they can help others in both their local and global community.

During Term 1, we held Advocacy Week at Kambala to support one of St John’s community services, called Rough Edges, a not-for-profit organisation that assists people in Sydney who are homeless or experiencing domestic violence.

Homelessness impacts approximately one in 200 Australians every night, with a third of those people being under 18 years of age. Rough Edges provides a safe, friendly living space along with free meals to those in need. Another aspect of Rough Edges is its Banksia Women program, which offers support to women who have experienced domestic violence, including case management, cooking classes, workshops and a walking group.

Throughout the week in our Mentor groups, students learned about homelessness and the wonderful work of Rough Edges. Students also had the opportunity to hear representatives from Rough Edges speak. We heard from Ryan, St John’s community services team leader and Grace, who leads the urban walks throughout the city. In which she further shared her own experiences of homelessness and addiction. It was great to see the lecture theatre full of staff and students and we were all humbled to hear Grace’s story.

To support Rough Edges, the Advocacy Committee held a drive for essential items such as face masks, reusable shopping bags and instant coffee. On the final day, the School had a mufti day and raised $2,354.

Advocacy Week was a great opportunity to learn more about the prevalence and causes of homelessness in Australia. The Advocacy Committee hopes to foster a strong relationship with St John’s and continue to support their amazing work in the future.",Donation/Philanthropy

In a statement today, Malakoff said the partnership also aims to assist businesses in Malaysia achieve its environmental goals through solar PV solutions.
“This tie-up will power up the logistic facilities of renowned industry players, namely Pos Malaysia Bhd, Northport (Malaysia) Bhd and Johor Port Bhd, with advanced solar PV systems, transforming the respective rooftops into solar powerhouses.
“The solar facilities installed will be under a Solar Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) ranging between 20 and 25 years. Upon completion, the total generation from these three (3) facilities are expected to produce approximately 11,609.90 MWh of clean electricity per annum. These will collectively neutralise about 8,057 tonnes of carbon emissions per year for the logistics industry,” Malakoff said.
Under the partnership, Solarvest will be undertaking the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) works, while Malakoff finances and owns the rooftop solar assets throughout the duration of the SPPAs.
Malakoff managing director cum chief executive officer Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib said it is vital for the group as the largest Independent Power Producer (IPP) in the country to enable access to sustainable energy for local industry providers and pave the way for businesses to reform its electricity consumption.
“We believe strongly that the investment in renewable energy is not only good for the environment but also makes good economic sense, especially for the logistics industry that operates 24/7.
“The fixed electricity tariff through SPPA will protect businesses from any potential price hikes and result in cost savings. This allows business owners to allocate more financial resources to fuel its future expansion,” he said.
Solarvest Group CEO Davis Chong Chun Shiong said the utilities industry in the country is in the midst of a rapid change, and that having an established independent power producer such as Malakoff investing in solar projects, further signifies the massive growth potential of the domestic renewable energy industry.
“There has been significant growth in demand for clean energy from the private sector, especially those that require high-level energy usage. This is evidenced in the rapid uptake for the quota allocated through the recent Net Energy Metering (NEM) programmes by commercial and industrial consumers.
“We aim to replicate such joint efforts with reputable renewable energy players such as Malakoff, in our endeavour to unlock more green energy to the nation,” Chong added.

"Tealive has opened its 600th store in Malaysia and plans to have 400 more new stores within the next three years. According to Tealive, the confidence comes from its “strong brand loyalty and continued focus on customer convenience and digital strategy”.
For store 600, based in Gelang Patah in Johor, the brand has now opened up a host of promotions. Founder and CEO Bryan Loo added that the brand is looking to open up at least 130 to 150 outlets a year, mainly in Johor, East Coast and Sabah, and Sarawak. Tealive now has 10 drive-through outlets and over 100 drive-in shops where customers can order ahead and park at dedicated bays for the drinks to be served to them in their cars.
“When the pandemic hit, we transformed ourselves quickly to launch our own bubble tea online e-commerce platform,” he said, adding that the brand was one of the earliest to launch a DIY bubble tea kit. This later won the brand the Gold for MARKETING-INTERACTIVE’s Asia eCommerce Awards and silver for the Marketing Excellence Awards. Loo added that the brand plans to focus on digitalising the business and prioritising customer convenience including various cashless and contactless ordering channels – scan to order, order ahead and drive-in model across the store network.
To date, it has formed numerous partnerships such as its collaboration with Affin Bank for the first bubble tea shop in a bank branch and it has also worked with Petronas Dagangan to set up Tealive stores inside Petronas Kedai Mesra shops since 2019.
At the store level, convenience also extended to the current Tealive 3.0 format featuring a dedicated bakery corner, Tealive Eats, and self-order standees at the entrance where customers could order and pay online before going in to pick up their orders.
In January, Tealive collaborated with Touch-n-Go to provide an “app-in-app” platform integrated with the e-wallet. It quickly became the top drinks brand transacted on Touch-n-Go e-wallet with over 200,000 transactions completed.
Innovation, Loo said, was also through brand extension into the FMCG segment as Tealive has shown its capabilities in extending beyond drinks. So far, it has collaborated with Walls to offer Boba Ice Cream and with Mamee Double Decker to bring the world’s first boba instant noodle.

Our process included working with key stakeholders from a variety of disciplines — school staff, faculty, students, community influencers and investors — to ensure relevance.

"Re-establish customer trust 
One in three Australians reported that their trust in banks had fallen from 2019 to 2020, compared to only 13 per cent in the US. 

To turn this around, banks should make the financial wellbeing of the customer their primary focus. They need to simplify managing money and educate customers to make the right decisions for themselves. The mantra for the future should be, “Don’t do anything unless it improves the customer experience.” 

As per Accenture’s Global Banking Consumer Study 2020, including a sample of 2,000+ Australian consumers, almost 50% customers said that banks provided them with the support they needed.

"""Friendship"" 

I received a text yesterday (5.09 pm) from a friend in Johor, who desperately asked for help because he could not breathe. I immediately called him - he was distressed, gasping for air and incessantly apologizing for his shortcomings while thanking me for the friendship. For the next 20 mins, vocally distraught, his wife was desperately trying to get him to hospital. Somehow I managed to get him to focus on my voice and introduce a basic breathing technique to calm him down. I had no idea what was happening. It was just chaotic. Heart attack? Covid? Anxiety attack? OMG. 

Throughout that period, I was seated on the edge of my sofa. I was just staring at the carpet right under my feet - not pacing up and down my study room as I normally would when dealing with a crisis. I was just focused on trying to ensure that he survives. The entire experience was extremely intense and stressful for all. 😳 

Fortunately, he did make it to the hospital at the end of the 20-minute call. 

At 5.29 pm, I jumped on to my next call not realizing the emotional impact that such an event can have on oneself. It took me a few minutes to compose myself before we could start the call. During the later part of the evening, I had so many questions like why did he call me? Why not a doctor friend? What if he had not made it while on the phone with me? What was he thinking? A very emotional evening for me indeed. 

I guess sometimes, you underestimate the value of your friendship to others - another lesson I just learnt as part of my journey of life.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less. C.S Lewis 

At the heart of humility is a desire to serve and a dedication to helping others become great. Many leaders seem to forget that leading others more than anything else should be held in reverence. Being the leader means that you have been placed in a position to serve others. 

Too often, I have seen leaders duck and cover, throw their people under the bus, throw their positional weight around, and instead of leading from a place of service, lead from a place of ego when things get rough. 

Never confuse humility with weakness; as a matter of fact, it takes great strength of will and character to put the needs of others before your own. To admit your mistakes, to be vulnerable, transparent, and fallible in front of your team. 

Humble leaders exhibit behaviors that lift their team's spirits, self-esteem, and confidence to achieve anything imaginable.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Most of us spend a lot of time making things big and complicated … then we stop.
We think the work is done.
Why? Because the solution is big, detailed, complete … and confusing.
Others tell us how clever we are … because we understand, and they don’t.
They pat us on the back, thanking us for our hard work, admiring our cleverness.
Because we confused them.
Some people cannot stop when the solution is big and complicated (and confusing).
To them the work is only partly done.
They keep going.
They cross the big red line of confusion.
They simplify, and simplify, and simplify.
And they stop when they reach simplicity.
Genuinely clever people don’t creat confusion then stop.
They can’t.
They abhor confusion.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Qatar’s largest dairy and beverage producer Baladna has signed a Memorandum of Collaboration (MoC) to produce fresh dairy products in Malaysia. 
The MoC agreed with Malaysia’s state-owned FELCRA Berhad (FELCRA) and agriculture giant FGV Holdings (FGV) aims to produce 100mn litres of fresh milk within the first full year of operation, pending the satisfactory completion of a feasibility study. 
The MoC is a key step forward in Baladna's international expansion plans, which include replicating the company's achievement in shifting Qatar from milk import dependency to self-sufficiency during the regional diplomatic crisis. 
Baladna will jointly invest in an integrated dairy farm in the town of Chuping in Perlis, which borders Thailand and is Malaysia’s smallest state. 
The initial focus is to establish a dairy herd of 10,000 high yielding milking cows. 
The parties aim to reduce Malaysia’s reliance on milk and dairy imports and support local communities. Other potential areas include utilising Malaysian agricultural land to produce most of the required animal feed for dairy farming, as well as using the joint venture farm as a hub that supports small rural farms in developing small cattle fatting farms and animal feed farms by 2024. 
Baladna Group chairman Moutaz al-Khayyat said, “We are proud to partner with FELCRA and FGV to transfer Baladna’s know-how and business model. This will ensure that Malaysia's fundamental nutritional needs are no longer majority dependent on imports. 
“With the support of our shareholders, we are increasingly transitioning to a truly international company. We look forward to sharing Baladna's experience and growing our footprint in Southeast Asia as part of our international expansion plans.”",Merger/Acquisition/Partnership

Automation is a term for technology applications where human input is minimized. Basic automation takes simple, rudimentary tasks and automates them. Process automation manages business processes for uniformity and transparency.

"As the COVID-19 crisis shows no signs of letting up and the lifting of lockdown still a distant prospect, the health and economic trauma confronting the nation is unprecedented. One of the most painful cries is the lack of food among families.

We at Valiram have always prided ourselves as a company that cares. The welfare of our employees has always been our No.1 Priority and since the onset of the outbreak of COVID-19, the company has always prioritised the employees’ wellbeing.

As an organisation, we know times have been hard and understand that some of our colleagues and associates have been affected by the circumstances of the prolonged Lockdown. With that, Valiram is proud to announce that we have launched a nationwide Valiram Foodbank Campaign on 23rd July 2021.

Called the VCare Foodbank Campaign, the campaign is about reaching out to the greater Valiram family in need of support and is also about lending a hand to the community we live and operate in. The Foodbank campaign is a staff-to-staff initiative for “Staff in Need by Staff who can Give”. Every ringgit raised by the staff will be matched by the company. The total amount then will be used to purchase essential food items which will be sent to staff in need on a weekly basis. Any surplus from this fund will then be channelled to a community centre of our choice at a later period. 

The Foodbank Campaign started off on a very positive note since its launch. On Day 4 post launch, we raised RM15,179 and funds are still coming in. As it stands the Valiram Foodbank Campaign has already raised a total of RM30,358. The RM15,179 raised by employees has been matched by the company, ringgit for ringgit. The Foodbank Campaign is an Ongoing initiative, and contributions have been coming in from Valiram employees across the region.

The deliveries of food baskets to employees in need across the country has began as of today, Friday 30th July 2021. The VCare Foodbank Campaign unites Valiram employees across the group to come together and support one another during this challenging time. We believe as the greater Valiram Family, we should stand united in caring for the wellbeing of each other.",Product/Service Launch

"Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd (BPMB) has today signed agreements with CGC Malaysia and the Minister of Finance (Incorporated) to buy all 100 per cent stake in Danajamin Nasional Berhad.

The acquisition is part of the government's medium-term plan to strengthen and align the mandates of development financial institutions (DFIs) to improve the national development finance ecosystem.

BPMB chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak said DFIs were an important component of any financial system.

""Strengthening of our DFIs will enhance their ability to support national economic development by availing capital to borrowers neglected by private banks, providing subsidised capital for priority sectors and crowding-in private capital to key segments of the economy.""

He added that the signing was a significant milestone as it not only confirmed the merger of BPMB and Danajamin, but formally set in motion a new phase for Malaysia's DFIs.

""We, at BPMB are fully supportive of the government's efforts and will work together with all stakeholders to ensure that the DFI ecosystem is supportive of the needs of the nation, especially in these challenging times.

"Honeywell International Inc. says it developed a commercially viable method to melt down low-grade plastic waste and turn it back into oil that’s good enough to feed into a refinery.

The maker of chemicals, automation equipment and aircraft parts is teaming up with the Spanish infrastructure company Sacyr SA to build and operate the first plant using the process, a facility they expect will transform 30,000 metric tons annually of mixed plastic trash into refinery feedstock. 

Honeywell is using technology it has honed for decades at its UOP unit to weed out impurities in hydrocarbons before they are refined into fuel and plastics, said Gavin Towler, chief technology officer at the company’s Performance Materials & Technologies unit. That’s being combined with automated systems to pick through bales of plastic trash and cull out unwanted materials. 

“Now, we’re at the point where the picking technology and the conversion technology can go together,” Towler said in a telephone interview. “We can handle mixed plastic waste. We can make it into high-quality oil.”

"“It gives the beneficiary of those YouTube video hits a diverse and well spread out geography of YouTube views,” Professor Ko said. “If it’s always the same computer doing that clicking, then it doesn’t look like it’s a genuine organic growth, but if it is a widespread network of different computers located around the world, that’s more convincing.” Generally, hacking for clicks was about increasing advertising revenue, he said. The more views on a video, the more valuable it would become. A video’s view count also played a role in determining the likelihood it would appear in users’ searches. “I think it will be more and more common over time because it’s a creative way to increase the number of views,” Professor Ko said. “I think the YouTube is also being challenged to detect the fake views. It’s a cat and mouse game.” The Sunwater spokesman said no website users or customers were redirected to the YouTube video. In an ordinary scenario, the clicks were happening “behind the scenes”, Professor Ko said. “It’s important to do the patching or software updates regularly ... When you close out the holes, the hackers can’t go into your computers to install things on your behalf,” he said. Sunwater reported the breach to the Australian Cyber Security Centre. It was soon closed because there was no impact to customers, the Sunwater spokesman said. “Sunwater took immediate steps to improve system security once it became aware of the issue,” he said.",Interview/Podcast

"Executive Director’s end-of-term message.
Dear colleagues, parents, caregivers and families, and friends,
At the end of the school term we have once again been reminded of the need to stay vigilant, with the COVID-19 situation in WA and Australia remaining unpredictable. During the last week of school, we have been taking all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our schools and the wider community, and through this week and the holidays, we can all play our part to limit the spread of the virus by following the latest advice from health authorities and government. I hope that the school holidays still offer you opportunities to rest and relax, to be re-energised and blessed through time spent with family, friends and loved ones.
We started 2021 celebrating two significant milestones – 200 Years of Catholic education in Australia, and 50 Years Together as a state-wide system in Western Australia. These anniversaries have been an invitation to reflect on the deep roots and strong culture underpinning our faith-based education and to celebrate the contribution that Catholic schools have made to society. The 200 and 50–year milestones have inspired activities in our schools and communities, and continue to shape some of the professional development and learning taking place as we consider the uncertainty of our present time and plan for the future needs of students.",Joining/Promotion/Experience

"Instead of being held back by the lack of women within the industry, Dani Hawley, Director of SEO at LevLane, credits where she is today to the challenges she’s faced during her 10-year tenure in SEO. “I was introduced into SEO marketing 10 years ago when it was relatively a new field for individuals to get into. At that time, there were many men in the industry and there wasn’t a large presence for women. Over the past 10 years, I have seen women really own the SEO space and the growth I have seen has been remarkable, especially within technical SEO. The biggest issue I continue to see is miscommunication from sales teams on SEO as it is difficult to comprehend. I took that as a challenge and developed a process for sales reps on how to sell SEO without overpromising. That was the moment I knew I wanted to stay in SEO. Over 10 years later, here I am a Director of SEO running a team! If it wasn’t for the challenges I faced at that job, I wouldn’t have been so interested in continuing on this journey.”",Interview/Podcast

"Three days in the office, two working from home? Or two weeks in the office, then two at home (or some other, more alluring remote locale)? Everyone in all the time, like in 2019? These are some of the options leaders are considering as they grapple with what going back to work should look like. Some of these new arrangements are landing uneasily. At Apple, for example, employees are pushing back against a policy requiring them to be in the office three days a week, describing a “disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote/location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees.” To get beyond this stressful push and pull, we need to reframe the conversation and focus on what we’re actually trying to achieve rather than where, precisely, we’ll be sitting when we achieve it. This involves examining the precise nature of the tasks in front of us, our specific objectives, and the weight we attach to the ones that compete, like efficiency, effectiveness, camaraderie, and mental health. Once we determine which parts of our work should be done in person, which should be virtual, and which can benefit from a mix, we can design toward that ideal.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

As part of its on-going efforts in championing diabetes awareness and prevention, Sun Life Malaysia, a life insurance and family takaful provider, has once again introduced its ‘Brighter Health Blood Glucose Screening Programme’ to provide complimentary blood glucose screening to 12,000 Malaysians nationwide. Raymond Lew, CEO and President/Country Head of Sun Life Malaysia said, “As the nation continues to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that we do not lose sight of the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases which are equally life-threatening. Many people have been delaying the much needed health services to diagnose and treat these diseases since the pandemic began. Therefore, it is vital that we continue to find ways to prevent and treat these chronic diseases, especially diabetes.” “In the case of diabetes, early detection is a key factor to prevent and even reverse diabetes. A simple act of getting your finger pricked to check the blood glucose level can be an effective way to assess the risks of developing diabetes and enable early detection which could avoid further health complications including kidney failure, heart problems and more.”",Donation/Philanthropy

"Undoubtedly, the pandemic has brought challenge and suffering to all Canadians in a host of different ways. As a working mom to two young boys, I fall into a group that feels affected—and in transparency, a group who just wants a little peace as my “gift” for Mother’s Day. Over the past few months, I’ve watched my friends and colleagues with kids at home (both moms and dads) struggle and seen the headlines and social posts talking about how moms are not okay. The statistics of women leaving the workforce because of unsustainable demands was, and is, exceptionally distressing. As a planner, I wanted to get strategic: getting into the issue beyond my own echo-chamber to bring deeper understanding of what’s happening – for myself and for our clients. With a group of 600 Canadian moms, we used the same research-based strategic approach and insight tools that we apply to our conversion-focused programs and found something that was tough to hear: not only are they not okay, many see themselves living the impact of this pandemic for years to come. And as key decision makers when it comes to household spending, it’s something we should all be paying attention to professionally, personally and culturally – as employers, friends, colleagues, partners and family members.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

The video was shared on Facebook and other social channels while integrating the content with email and digital media. Potential donors were directed to a campaign based landing page. This integrated approach – one we call “The Gin and Tonic approach” pairs creative that cuts through with a strong fundraising proposition that truly motivates people to act.

"I'm in my second year as an adjunct #advertising professor at the University of Miami. I love learning what my students are into and what has their attention. Last night, we talked about the old rules vs. the new rules of advertising. Here are some things I heard - Older ads appealed to them because they came across as honest with clear explanations of features and benefits. - Most of today's humorous ads aren't even funny; they're just offbeat and weird. - They disagree that digital advertisers only have one or two seconds to get their attention. If you treat them honestly, instead of trying to appeal to them with a shtick or stunt, they'll stick around.- They will engage or follow certain brands BECAUSE they know they'll get ads that are curated to their interests. - They think most ads are noisy. They still like Apple because the ads are clean, simple and clear. Lastly, the class had three ads they remembered vividly. The problem? They remembered the wrong brand for two of them. There was one ad that they all remembered both the product and the brand selling it. The ad got their attention, educated/informed them AND removed barriers to purchase. And it was 3:30 long. The digital consumer isn't too distracted to pay attention to ads. They're just not seeing much worth paying attention to. Shoutout to Dr. Squatch — they're the ones who produced that memorable spot.

"Google is back at it with another algorithm update — and just in time to scare us for the chilling holiday ahead. Much to search and content marketers’ dismay (or at least to my own), their only constant seems to be change. But, at least Google keeps us on our toes, right? *Laughs nervously.* As capricious as Google may be, each update promises improved search results for users across the globe. According to the search giant, they’re “bringing the most advanced AI into [their] products to further [their] mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Last week, they announced an update on passage ranking (initially known to SEOs as passage indexing, but more on that later). This update focuses on excerpts from a page rather than considering one topic for an entire page. Right now, Google checks if an entire page is relevant to a search query before displaying it on the SERP. After implementing their new passage understanding capabilities, Google will determine if a specific passage of a page is more relevant to a particular query than a broader page on that topic. Once the update rolls out at the end of this year, Google estimates it will affect 7% of search queries globally.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Today data has gone to the top of the command chain. But that's not necessarily a good thing - as it has also become a gate-keeper for creative thought. This massive swing to a data-first world has clipped the wings of our creativity. The problem is data can’t create desire, only emotion can. And emotion is what drives action. I've always been a science guy. Numbers, logic, reason, analysis, research, hypotheses, and testing are the things that make sense to me. When you have information and a process to interrogate that information, the truth becomes clearer. The more you interrogate, the clearer the truth becomes. The scientific method works - every time. Throughout my career I've relied exclusively on the scientific method to solve client problems. I've found success in this and produced useful work. For some clients, me and my team destroyed all other traditional marketing efforts because it was impossible to compete with our performance. For every dollar we spent, we generated a multiple of that dollar in results, as predicted. Two times, three times, ten times. Every month our budgets would increase as we took money away from other channels and agencies. I remember with guilt that one agency we worked with folded because they lost their biggest ATL client to our digital team of two. Overall, I stopped thinking. In fact, embarrassingly, this became a part of my pitch - ""What we think doesn't matter. Only the data matters."" In many ways it was also useful for abdicating responsibility for our work with a “well the data said” safety net.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Cleaver-Brooks announces that its ProFire SBR-30 Series Burner was named a winner in the 2021 Commercial Comfort Products of the Year contest. Selected by a panel of independent consulting/specifying engineers, the burner series topped the Heating Equipment category. The ProFire SBR-30 low-NOx, dual-fuel burner is capable of less than 30 ppm NOx emissions without flue gas recirculation (FGR). It features a unique firing head design to achieve controlled combustion, leading to low emissions with 3% O2. Advanced technology allows the SBR-30 to offer low-NOx, low CO emissions and up to 10:1 turndown on natural gas. “A number of benefits are created by the removal of FGR,” said Kevin Pheney, Cleaver-Brooks vice president of burner systems. “Eliminating the need for FGR in high-stack-temperature steam boilers will increase energy efficiency by 0.5-1.5%, extending the turndown and minimizing on-off cycling. In addition to being massive and space consuming, FGR pipes generate extensive energy loss in the boiler room. All of this can be eliminated by using the SBR-30 non-FGR solution.”",Awards/Recognition/Achievement

"Google is renaming Google My Business to Google Business Profile, as it moves efforts to bringing more of the business profile management out of the Google My Business app and directly into Google Search, Google Maps and those respective apps. The new name. Google Business Profile will be the new name going forward for Google My Business. Google said the reason for the new name is to “keep things simple” and sometime in 2022, Google will retire the Google My Business app completely. Another new name you say? We are now calling it Google Business Profile, before that it was named Google My Business, before that, Google Places, and before that it was Google+ Local, before that it was also Google Places and then prior to that I think it was just Google Local. Yes, the local business management product has been through many names, I think I am even forgetting some previous names the product had. Google My Business going away. What does it mean that Google My Business name is going away? Well, Google is encouraging businesses to manage their single listings directly on Google Search or Google Maps, either via the web interface or mobile apps. Yes, for a long time now, Google lets businesses manage their individual listings directly in the search results or directly in Google Maps, now Google is saying it prefers businesses with single listings manage their businesses in Search or Maps and not in the old Google My Business console. Google said it that the existing Google My Business web experience will transition to primarily support larger businesses with multiple locations, and will be renamed “Business Profile Manager.” Google will redirect and rebrand the Google My Business web interface, in fact, I personally still use google.com/places to be directed to google.com/business right now. If you manage multiple locations for your business and/or you are a local SEO that manages a number of businesses, you will still continue to use an interface like Google My Business, renamed to Business Profile Manager going forward. There may be changes to the Business Profile Manager throughout the upcoming months.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"For anyone who doubted, the data is in. The Great Resignation is real and it’s happening. The U.S. Department of Labor reports that during the months of April, May, and June 2021 a total of 11.5 million workers quit their jobs. And it’s not over. According to Gallup research, 48 percent of employees are actively looking to make a change, and according to Personio research, nearly 1:4 will do so in the next six months. Those looking for new opportunities will find ripe opportunities; in June the U.S. hit an all-time high of 10.1 million job openings. What does this all mean to your organization? You are likely juggling two pressing needs: hiring to backfill people who have left and hiring new people to support business growth. The scarcity is real — too few people for too many jobs. The imbalance of this supply-demand highlights more than ever that productivity is about people. The best way to stabilize your business is to stem the tsunami of attrition and increase your retention. In the frantic need to hire more people, the group we often forget to attend to are the folks who stay — those showing up day-in and day-out shouldering the work that needs to get done. Think about what these people — the ones who are here, working for and with you — need now. The short answer is they need to be seen for who they are and what they are contributing. It’s your job as the leader to make sure they’re getting the recognition they deserve.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"At some point this fall, Calavo Growers Inc. is expecting to open a new distribution center in Portland, OR, to better service its customers in the Pacific Northwest, including Canada. Rob Wedin, executive vice president of fresh sales for the Santa Paula, CA-based company, said Calavo is continually upgrading its facilities to better serve the changing needs of the retail and foodservice industries. For example, it has added a new bagging machine in the United States this year to help meet the growing demand for bagged avocados. “We try to do as much bagging as we can at the packing facilities in Mexico but having additional bagging capacity up here (in the U.S.) gives us flexibility,” he said. Bagged avocados have been gaining market share for the last several years, receiving a big boost during this time of COVID-19 as consumers are anxiously buying lots of bagged produce for the perceived safety of buying product that has been touched by fewer hands. Wedin said bagged avocados have attracted consumers throughout the product line. He noted that there are bagged organic avocados as well as large, medium and small sized fruit presented in that fashion. He said the very small fruit — 84s and smaller — has become less popular but every other bagged option is seeing increased sales.",Product/Service Launch

"The next big supply chain disruption requires real world solutions. There has been good information shared on lessons learned to reduce supply risk before/during the pandemic.Unfortunately there is less useful information on how to prepare for the next big supply chain disruption as most of them are ""textbook"" guidance.Those are fine for studying theory, but fall short when it comes to the real world.In my experience, this can be accomplished in 3 phases.Phase 1 - dentify risks.Identifying risks is based on macro-economic factors, industry specific risks, and your own business risk situation.Phase 2 - Prioritize your risks.An effective way to prioritize risk is using predictability and impact to the business quadrants.Phase 3 - Translate prioritized risk to a contingency plan.A good approach is to work proactively to mitigate risk by individual sectors (predictability vs. impact quadrants) and develop a common core of preventive measures. This is easier said than done.Some of the challenges encountered and discussed with other professionals are:· Lack of process· Resource availability to properly support ffort· Unclear scope· Difficulty moving past the conference room theory· Reverting to a more data driven prioritization during phase 2.But we must continue to strive for real world solutions.Supply chain disruptions cannot be solved with answers from the back of a textbook.What are your challenges in preparing for the next big supply chain disruption and how are you handling them?",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"his post was originally published in April 2020. It was edited to reflect industry updates. Influencers continue to be all the rage in consumer marketing, so one of the biggest questions we get from current and potential clients is “how does this relate to the ag market?” How much influence do ag influencers have? Are they relevant? Should they be considered as a vehicle to reach the target audience or as a target themselves? Ag is a niche market within the immense world of social media, so some clients and prospective clients have understandably questioned whether social media is worthy of a share of their limited budgets. Engagement vs. Reach One important consideration is the difference between reach and engagement. In the offline world, reach is the number of readers, viewers or listeners. Marketers love the big numbers reported with reach because they mean a lot of potential customers have been touched. However, when it comes to social media, reach is the number of followers an influencer has. That potential pool to reach is not nearly as important – or valuable – as engagement. Engagement, in its simplest terms, is the number of likes, shares, comments, or other direct interaction with a social media post. Production ag influencers might be nano (1,000-10,000 followers) or micro (10,000-100,000 followers) influencers, but don’t let the smaller number of followers be a deterrent. There is quite a bit of research that shows these smaller influencers tend to have higher engagement rates than influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"You’re seated at a rustic picnic table. A handsome sommelier with slicked-back hair and an ambiguous continental accent gently places two identical stems in front of you. In each glass rests 5 ounces of visually identical pinot—dainty in body, luscious in color. The sommelier instructs you to choose a wine but without getting a taste. He grants you a sniff, but you perceive no difference. You ask for the name of each, but you haven’t heard of either, and they both sound equally lovely. Just before you give up and choose one at random, the man says, ‘Oh, by the way, the wine on the right just launched a TV ad campaign this week. Let me pull it up for you.” “No need,” you say. “I’ll have the one on the left.” For wine, as with law firms, restaurants and sports cars, the more likely it is to advertise, the less likely we are to covet it. How can the entire discipline of advertising be off-limits to a $63 billion-a-year business? Wine is the second most popular drink in the U.S. behind beer. But the beer industry spends about $1.5 billion annually on advertising in the U.S., while winemakers spend a little over $100 million. That’s less than even cider brands spend. And it’s not because wine drinkers are some hard-to-reach niche of elites—46 percent of Americans have consumed wine at home in the past three months, per Mintel. You could throw a dart at a map and hit a wine drinker.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV), a global leader in intelligent, multi-domain robotic systems, today announced it was awarded a competitive task order valued at approximately $22 million on May 21, 2021 from the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for ISR services using JUMP® 20 medium unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) at an undisclosed customer location. The ISR services include the first SATCOM-enabled unmanned aircraft system for beyond line of sight operations as part of the existing Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MEUAS IV contract. The task order specifies a 12-month period of performance and multiple follow-on option years for ISR services. “The JUMP 20 delivers an unmatched level of versatility, with runway and infrastructure independence, multiple payload configurations, class-leading endurance and a track record of reliability and ruggedness,” said Gorik Hossepian, AeroVironment vice president and product line general manager for medium UAS. “The inclusion of a SATCOM payload adds beyond line of sight operation to the JUMP 20, providing our customer with expanded reach and situational awareness, and representing another game-changing, market-leading capability.” The AeroVironment JUMP 20 is the first fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) to be deployed extensively in support of U.S. military forces. Ideal for multi-mission operations, JUMP 20 delivers 14+ hours of endurance, a standard operational range of 185 km (115 mi) and is runway independent. The system can be set up and operational in less than 60 minutes without the need for launch or recovery equipment and has a useable payload capacity of up to 30 pounds. The JUMP 20 also features a common autopilot and ground control system architecture providing a highly customizable, modular platform which can be custom-configured to meet operational or customer requirements.",Merger/Acquisition/Partnership

Spirit AeroSystems leveraged its unmatched design-for-manufacturing expertise to redesign the spoiler to a fully integrated, out-of-autoclave, single-shot RTM solution for Airbus. The new spoiler production system delivers significantly improved manufacturing and cost efficiencies, including reduced energy consumption and material waste, compared to the previous hand laid-up, honeycomb core stiffened, and autoclave cured process. The elimination of multiple autoclave cure cycles means that production requires fewer tools and a shorter flow time, contributing to a more sustainable process. The end result is a highly automated system, which is optimized across quality, rate, and cost.",Awards/Recognition/Achievement

"Most people save the annual review, feel-good posts for the final week of the year. Not me. After realizing the significance of this day, this morning....I couldn't help but jump on the alliterative opportunity of #22til22 🙌🏻 2021 has been a year of tremendous growth for us here at Silverback Strategies. This evolution, however, hasn’t come without pain, a few learning curves…and a whole lot of change. As I approach the final “sprint” of ‘21–with a full heart (and belly) after a fun-filled Thanksgiving weekend–I can’t help but have a lot of pride in what our team has accomplished. We faced bandwidth challenges head-on; we committed to a reorganization into #Troops to align our service delivery with the value clients expect of a performance agency in today’s environment, and my sales and marketing teams have had to pivot strategy a time or two (...or three!) as the learnings from Troops impacted our value prop + positioning. But one thing has been a constant: Our team's resolve and commitment to evolving into a better version of themselves–and Silverback. I am energized to come to work each week with this team and can't wait to see our hard work in 2021 pay dividends in the months to come. As I told my team this morning: Let's roll up our sleeves and kick the ass of this final 2021 sprint!

Globally, more than 2 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, including toilets. The United Nations General Assembly officially designated Nov. 19 as World Toilet Day in 2013 to raise awareness and inspire efforts to bring solutions to these communities. A study of 130,000 health clinics in low- and middle-income countries showed that 50 percent of the clinics didn't have piped water. Additionally, 785 million people do not have clean water close to home. Without access to safe toilets and clean water, women often wait for the cover of darkness to have privacy and safety, children can succumb to life-threatening, waterborne diseases, and millions of girls miss school because menstruation becomes too hard to manage.",Product/Service Launch

"It's been one full year today - one hell of a year, in fact - since I started my journey at Ovative Group. As I've reflected on my year, and thought about what this experience has meant to me, it is truly difficult for me to put into words. So here is what I have to offer: As an Enneagram type 8, I am an intense person in almost everything that I do. I rarely shy away from conflict, I have strong opinions about what is right and what is wrong and I am fearless in the pursuit of achieving the best results I can in the strategies that I put together for my clients. I am deeply protective of those who report to me, and work along side of me, and this is not something I'm timid about. (I can think of a few past-supervisors, and probably current, wondering to themselves as they read this - ""what *are* you timid about?""These attributes have frequently been used against me throughout my career, casted in a negative light, even used to withhold promotions from me because I needed to work on my ""tone."" And to be fair, all this is certainly not to say my tone didn't need work, my edges didn't need smoothing and my delivery didn't need finessing. But Ovative is one of the first places in my professional career that I have felt truly celebrated for these parts of who I am, where I have been told privately and publicly how valued my genuine nature is, while still being coached on where I can improve. This is the first place I have been fully empowered to be who I am, do my best every day and get a little bit better tomorrow.This experience, the leadership style, the work, the people - all of it. It is hard to put into words. But I am oh so thankful that I am here. I'm thankful for all of the opportunities I've been able to take advantage of, and lessons I've been able to learn this last year, and I am ready for so much more. As we like to say here at Ovative - here's to ""raising the fuckin bar"" on year #2. #leadership #career #experience #work #opportunities",Awards/Recognition/Achievement

"Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company, are bringing Dell’s cyber recovery vault to the AWS Marketplace with the launch of Dell EMC PowerProtect Cyber Recovery for AWS. Through the AWS Marketplace, customers can easily purchase and deploy an air-gapped cyber vault from Dell, the leading provider of data protection appliances & software globally1, to help securely protect and isolate data away from a ransomware attack. Dell EMC PowerProtect Cyber Recovery for AWS provides multiple layers of protection with a modern approach that allows AWS customers to resume normal business operations quickly and confidently after a cyberattack. The solution moves a customer’s critical data away from the attack surface, physically and logically isolating it with a secure, automated operational air gap. Unlike standard backup solutions, this air gap locks down management interfaces, requiring separate security credentials and multi-factor authentication for access. “Data is a strategic asset, and protecting it against ransomware and other cyberattacks is critical for organizations to make informed decisions about their business and thrive in today’s digital economy,” said David Noy, vice president of data protection product management, Dell Technologies. “By teaming with AWS, we are offering customers a cyber recovery solution that isolates business-critical data away from an attack with an air-gapped cyber vault, helping organizations reduce risk and protect data with confidence after a successful cyberattack.” As organizations continue to adopt diverse IT infrastructures, across the public cloud and on-premises environments, data protection solutions can improve data security. According to the 2021 Dell Technologies Global Data Protection Index survey of 1,000 global IT decision makers, 67% of organizations lack confidence that all business-critical data can be recovered in the event of a destructive cyberattack.

"“Your role as a leader is to bring out the best in others, even when they know more than you.” Dr. Wanda Wallace. Many people in leadership positions believe that to be an effective leader, they must be the most intelligent person at their company, and if they are not, it will somehow send a signal to their staff that the leader is somehow inept. But no one is an expert in everything; the strongest businesses are built on the smartest people – not on one person. Great leaders aren’t know-it-alls who constantly try to outshine everyone. Instead, they admit when they’re wrong and genuinely want to learn from others. At the end of the day, it’s not about being the smartest person in the room.

The theme is “Connected, we thrive” and I think everyone who attends will leave set up to flourish in their organizations, fundraising efforts, and personally within their roles. There are so many great topics being covered by an incredible group of speakers but there are a few that stood out to us. The last 18 months have taken a significant toll on many long-standing organizations and several were already experiencing challenges prior to the pandemic starting. We think the more organizations are willing to openly share their struggles, solutions, successes and fails, the more it will help others experiencing the same challenges, which brings me to our first stand-out session.

"Over the past two decades due in great part to the Internet, the power of the customer has increased significantly. We can now search options and prices, share, and learn from experiences of others, interact with Brands, and get products and services delivered in a myriad of ways at far greater speeds. Companies do not enable and empower but need to deal with empowered and enabled people. People who due to the power of technology have “God-like” power. Combine this with the increased power of platforms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Snap, Tik-Tok, Disney, Walmart, Target, etc. which are business drivers and not just communication or marketing channels, requires a re-thinking of marketing. In addition, the demographic shifts of rising multi-ethnicity, combined with the sharp divide in the mindset, media usage, social concerns and financial outlook among youth and a rapidly aging population, further roils the landscape.

"The U.S. light-vehicle sales forecast comes in at about 15.5 million units for 2022. That is a 2.7% increase from 2021’s estimate of 15.1 million, according to IHS Markit. The report also predicts that it could take until 2024 or even 2025 for the auto industry to satisfy pent-up demand and fully rebuild new-vehicle inventories. The shortage goes beyond the microchip issue. It has been exacerbated by a lack of skilled workers and truck drivers, coupled with supply chain bottlenecks. Analysts expect vehicle production to reach 15.2 million next year, marking a 14.7% improvement from 2021. If production reaches the forecasted 17.2 million units in 2023, it will eclipse pre-pandemic 2019’s figures for the first time.

""Following a thorough process to determine the right location for our state-of-the-art, greenfield sheet mill, we are thrilled to make this significant investment in West Virginia and enhance our presence in this important region,"" said Leon Topalian, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""Our new sheet mill in Mason County will have unmatched capabilities that will enable the continued expansion of high-quality, low carbon steels, building on our industry-leading offerings. We are pleased to create hundreds of new, high-paying jobs, and position West Virginia as a leader in clean steel production.

Galvanizing capabilities will include an advanced high-end automotive line with full inspection capabilities as well as a construction-grade line. In addition to its advanced capabilities and optimal strategic location, the new greenfield mill will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than competitors who have historically supplied the region. Construction is expected to take two years pending permit and regulatory approvals. Additional sites in Northern West Virginia are also under consideration for a transload and processing facility.",New Expansion

"Earlier today, I placed second in the Boston Marathon Military March of 26.2 miles with a time of 6 hours & 25 minutes. Running is not authorized in our category while wearing full military field uniform. I could have placed first but I ran into an Air Force Special Forces veteran at mile 20 who was cramping and needed help. As we learn in the military on day one, we never leave a comrade behind. I told the veteran he was either going to cross the finish line on his own or I was going to carry him across if I had to. Luckily, he persevered and made it though on his own. At the finish line, the two of us & another stranger did 22 pushups each to raise awareness for the 22 military veterans who commit suicide (on average) due to PTSD each day. It was great to see amazing strength and resilience of Boston back in action after 18 long months of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the march, I prayed for people who have been impacted by the COVID-19 virus and/or struggle with the mental health issues due to the lockdowns. I also honored the first responders, nurses, doctors, military personnel & front-line workers who have sacrificed so much so the rest of us can live somewhat normal lives.

"There are no gimmicks here. The answer is to focus on creativity in your work. It’s been scientifically proven, backed by statistics, and… well, it’s kinda just common sense. Since I’ve already spilled the beans, let’s start with statistics and science. Creative work performed, on average, 11 times more efficiently than noncreative work. Les Binet and Peter Field analyzed nearly 600 case studies submitted to IPA over 20 years, cross-referencing them with campaigns that won creative awards recognized by Warc Rankings. Simply put, they found that creatively awarded work was, on average, 11 times more efficient at driving market share growth than non-creatively awarded work. To put that in perspective, a brand campaign that costs, say, 1 million dollars will perform just as well as its non-creative 11-million-dollar counterpart, according to Binet and Field. But I don’t believe that’s the whole truth. Binet and Field aren’t telling the whole story when they say creative work is “more effective.” It’s not that creativity itself is driving results. It’s what all good creative has in common that drives results– it’s what creative work does that makes it 11 times more efficient. Creativity enables mental availability. If I asked you to instantly observe the details of everything in your field of view right now, you wouldn’t be able to. You could go one by one. Think about what you’re hearing, shift your gaze to an object to take in details one by one, perhaps think about what you’re smelling… but you couldn’t do those things simultaneously.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

But as recruiting efforts for skills failed, and my interest in producing items persisted: I decided to take a journey and simply try to learn. It’s not about trying to become a Rembrandt or a Van Gogh, but rather an appreciation of how any skill you have an interest in learning is available if you invest the time and energy to grow it.

"The world is at a crossroads as we face the need to reduce global carbon emissions to zero by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate change. Despite this fact, many, if not most, oil companies are not moving quickly, or at all, to wind down their carbon-polluting businesses and shift to clean energy, as the International Energy Agency and a global chorus of climate scientists insist must happen now to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. As wildfires, mega-storms and extreme weather worsen due to climate change, people are growing more frustrated with the lack of action on climate, and this ire is increasingly directed at Big Oil. This anger is the force behind the current backlash against PR giant Edelman, which has been accused of greenwashing on behalf of its client, Exxon Mobil, and is gaining notoriety for its longtime work for the oil and gas industry. More than 100 celebrities and influencers signed a November letter asking Edelman to drop Exxon and other fossil fuel companies. And a new study from Brown University researchers found that PR firms, working on behalf of oil companies, have helped shape and obstruct public discussion about climate change.

Not only did I appreciate its craftsmanship and sentimental value, but I also treasured what it symbolized: the value of time. I’ve always been a “time” person. From a young age, as I wrote about in a previous LinkedIn article, my father, a high school principal, taught me about its worth and its finite nature. So naturally, that Seiko marked the beginning of my lifetime fascination with watches. I consider time, and making it count—whether it be at work, spending time with my family, or when I’m racing against it in a cycling event—as one of my top personal core values. But in addition to time, another of my other core values is the pursuit of excellence.",LinkedIn impressions/activity
"We know kids do better when they have access to sport, and the 2022 Nike Community Impact Fund (NCIF) is ready to help make that happen in the communities where our employees live, work and play. Since 2009, NCIF has awarded $10 million through 1,000+ grants to grassroots nonprofits that help create active communities and get kids moving. This year, we’ll keep the momentum going with $1.5 million in grants to support local programs in 14 key cities and employee backyards across the U.S., Europe and Asia. What makes the program so special: We invite our employees to share their local insights and play a leading role in choosing the grantees — because no one knows what their neighborhood needs more than the people who live there. “The opportunity to give back to our community was super exciting and rewarding,” says Nike Watts Community Store Head Coach Paola De La Cruz, who helped determine last year’s NCIF grantees for her neighborhood. “As a team, we selected local organizations such as East Side Riders Bike Club, Watts Skills Academy, and SISTERS OF WATTS, and we’ve seen those funds go to work, allowing our partners to purchase backpacks, school clothes and sports equipment for kids in our neighborhoods.” An organization in your neighborhood can be part of that positive impact too.

"Socializing is a vital part of our lives — it helps us feel more connected and create community. When we’re apart, using social media makes it easier to stay in touch and maintain those connections. It has other benefits, too, such as allowing us to practice social skills in a low-stakes environment, find new friends through shared interests, and preserve memories. But we all know that social media isn’t without its downsides. Many of us can relate to losing track of time or feeling unmotivated after a mindless scroll. And it’s easy to feel lonely when we’re only communicating virtually, or worse, we might feel a sense of low self-worth in comparison to the pictures of perfection we see online — whether they represent reality or not. If you’re hoping to establish a healthier relationship with social media, understanding the impact it has on conditions like loneliness or anxiety is key. With this knowledge, we can learn how to take a mindful approach to social media use, gaining greater control over our digital behaviors and feeling less controlled by them in our real lives.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Completely agree with Dr. Kim Hires … In a Harvard Business Review article “Times Up For Toxic Workplaces” They recommend: (1) companies increase awareness + educate managers about costs associated with abusive conduct. (2) incorporate/strengthen anon feedback channels where employees can voice concerns + report abusive experiences without fear of retribution. (3) uphold + enforce fair and ethical norms in all aspects of company life, because employees reflect upon these values before deciding whether to stand up to abuse or not.

"A newly-developed camera the size of a grain of salt can take clear, full-color images—at the level of cameras that are 500,000 times larger. Researchers at Princeton University and the University of Washington created a new type of optical system, called a metasurface, to shrink the camera’s hardware down to size, and combined this with machine-learning image processing that enables the camera to produce clear images in natural lighting. Previously, micro-cameras could only produce useful images in perfect laboratory settings, according to the researchers. Their work is published in the journal Nature. Each camera consists of 1.6 million cylindrical posts which interact with light to produce the images. These posts are as small as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

"It took me so long to realize what being “a creative” actually meant. It doesn’t matter the discipline, the medium you work with, how it is shared, or how many eyes actually see the end product. Creativity is just vision. Rewind to 2009 where the stage was where I personally expressed this- it was the same thing as I feel every single day in my life now, just with (slightly) less glitter. The exhaustion of striving to be a better performer every single day, the moment before the audience arrupts (or the client gives you feedback), and the discipline to allow yourself to fail, pick yourself back up, and try the fuck again. Thank you Shannon King for outing me as a theater nerd, and for reminding me of where it all started. And thank you to Greater Hartford Academy Arts for teaching kids of all walks of life to follow their dreams. I hope we have made you proud.",Event/Seminar
"At the forefront of workplace culture during a time of constant change, Rebel Interactive Group, a digital marketing agency based in Southington, Connecticut, released RebelWare, a suite of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) tools aimed at transforming and simplifying the way small and medium-sized businesses navigate the changing professional landscape. Rebel recently experienced rapid expansion in headcount and physical space–nearly doubling their employees in less than a year, leading to investments in new office space and the launch of several business ventures under the Rebel Realm. But with that expansion has come growing pains. However, with his decades of experience in developing SaaS products, Rebel CEO and Owner, Bryn Tindall, realized he and his team would be able to create solutions, both for them and their clients. “I couldn’t believe the impact these tools had on our organization. It was amazing to see the efficiency gained right before our eyes. RebelWare exists because we needed it to — and now we’re incredibly passionate about helping other businesses like us not suffer through growth and repetitive tasks like we did,” said Allison Minutillo, President & Owner of Rebel Interactive Group.The RebelWare SaaS suite started with paid time off management software, Leaf, and quickly evolved into additional software solutions. Scout is a streamlined workforce recruiting process system; IT ticketing system cleverly named Tinker; and Spark, which allows companies to close the gap – and the loops – on lead generation. The success seen internally led Rebel to realize that other companies can benefit from these SaaS products.",Product/Service Launch

"For the better part of the past decade, Facebook and other social channels have been limiting the organic exposure of messaging, forcing brands and marketers to resort to paid (AKA “boosted”) posts to reach target audiences. As Didit noted way back in 2016, Facebook’s actions to limit organic post reach were already forcing marketers to “work much harder to reach the audiences that will find them relevant” by relying on paid channels and mastering the nuances of buying this media at auction. The past five years have also seen the rise of influencer marketing, a social channel that, in the majority of circumstances, is an exclusively paid field wherein individuals are rewarded – financially or via free products — by endorsing branded products. During that time, the size of global influencer marketing has grown from $1.6 billion to $13.8 billion. A third trend — of brands “putting on the publisher’s hat” by publishing/curating “earned media” content via blog articles, podcasts, videos, and other media — has also taken hold. According to HubSpot, 70 percent of U.S. companies now actively invest in some form of content marketing. The simultaneous convergence of these three trends has created a uniquely challenging environment in which brands must think more holistically about their messaging — and messaging delivery strategies — to successfully reach audiences. This synergetic approach, involving the coordination of strategy and execution across paid social, influencer, and organic content creation/curation channels, uses each channel to support the other and thereby multiply overall campaign strength.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"In my prior role as CIO of IBM, and now in my current role as Chief Digital Officer at Cisco, I’ve witnessed three distinct phases to this pandemic, which I’ve categorized as follows: Phase I: Technology (this article)Phase II: CybersecurityPhase III: Culture. As I reflect on the past two years of the pandemic, there are lots of lessons learned from an IT perspective and I’ve assembled a practical, real-world checklist for each phase that IT departments can leverage.In this first installment, I'll share the lessons learned from the first phase of the pandemic: Technology. Network modernization, adoption of SaaS, effective collaboration tools, and embracing Agile ways of working are key to surviving a global crisis like Covid. To be sure, these are important goals even in the best of times, but they became existential requirements during the pandemic. The first serious signs of Covid began to appear (at least on my radar) in January 2020. Images of Wuhan and the extreme measures being taken to sterilize streets, decontaminate surfaces, and quarantine large cities were very worrying. More specifically, these actions indicated something more serious than the common flu, and I remember very clearly bringing the leadership team together to begin planning for the possibility that we might need to quickly shift virtually 100% of our global workforce to remote. And thus began what I’ll call phase 1 of the pandemic: Technology. This phase was, in retrospect, the clearest and most actionable phase of the pandemic from an IT perspective, and was very focused on remote access, business continuity, and video conferencing quality. Covid did not radically alter the technical roadmap for most IT organizations. instead, out of necessity, it compressed what might have organically taken 10 years to accomplish into 10 intense months of transformation. Below I summarize everything I’ve learned over the past two years into three checklists: one for each phase of the pandemic: technology, cybersecurity, and culture.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

DC has launched a dedicated Data + Tech Practice with new leadership and the rollout of our proprietary analytics tool, the Table™ - offering our clients rapid insights on integrated campaign performance, and helping drive insights for creative and media. Our chief integration officer, Gary Stein got the inspiration for the name from the general idea of wanting to sit across the table with all stakeholders (client, creatives, strategists, media, etc) and have easier conversations about what all that data means. He often says “The problem isn’t that there’s not enough data. The problem has been there’s too much and not a clear way to connect it into meaningful insights.” (The other inspiration for the name, the Table™, is from a rad song, Crowded Table, by the Highwomen.)",Product/Service Launch

"As Americans now approach the third year of living in the pandemic, attitudes and habits have evolved since its initial onset. People continue to be hesitant to leave their house to socialize and are tired of being cooped up at home. In talking with friends and family and browsing social media, it seems like a lot of people have found new ways to function from home yet still are craving new hobbies and products to keep life entertaining. And from what has been shared about Super Bowl LVI advertising so far, it appears that many brands are taking advantage of this pandemic mentality. New brands to the Super Bowl like Hologic Inc., Caesars Sportsbook, Carvana and Planet Fitness have realized that capturing audiences now is more valuable than when people resume life without a pandemic lens. And while the Super Bowl is undoubtedly an awareness play expected to reach more than 100 million viewers, gone are the days of the “no-message messages” like the Bud, Weis and Er Frog spot from the early 90s (look it up, Gen Z).",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"Let's start with the prevailing medical and governmental positions on both Delta and Omicron. In its latest guidelines, the CDC has reduced quarantine requirements by half while both the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists as well as the WHO have indicated that although Omicron is highly transmissible, it is also far less critical for vaccinated populations. However, the third wave of spikes are sickening people and putting another strain on healthcare systems around the world. Most scientific communities believe Omicron will peak in mid-January, but lower-than-optimal vaccination rates in parts of the world are still a concern. In consumer survey after consumer survey, people also indicate they have moved past many of their fears and willingness to adhere to lockdowns. Judgement aside, this is good for travel unless Covid protocols continue to be knee-jerk in nature and inconsistent & confusing in practice. In our view, the travel industry has been unfairly penalized with policies that do not reflect the relative risk versus other social activity. We hope this will change in the near-term. Government response has once again been mixed, with policies varying by international regions and US states & cities. In Pan Asia and Australia the border controls are back in place, albeit less severe, though Hong Kong has again banned visitors. In much of Europe, restrictions have been relatively severe in terms of testing, vaccination and documentation, but borders are mostly remaining open. In the United States, some large cities such as New York and San Francisco require proof of vaccination for events and hospitality while others don't require vaccination or masks. The US remains largely open for business while Canada, the aforementioned Asia, and Australia continue to be the most restrictive. We see most controls being relaxed again in February, with the tenor of politicians, most notably Biden, Johnson and Trudeau, as much more optimistic than in 2020.",LinkedIn impressions/activity

"LBB> What do you think is the difference between a strategist and a planner? Is there one? Laura> The dual language of both planning and strategy exemplifies the nuances of this dynamic role. At Curiosity we articulate the functions of our departments as strategy owning both the ‘who’ and the ‘why’ of our work - creative is our ‘what’ and activation is our ‘how’. But I see planning as the through line. The planning portion of strategy takes the result of the who, what, why and how and ensures that all of our great thinking reaches the right people, at the right time with the right message. I consider myself a strategist first, who needs to be a planner in order to get ideas into the real world. That’s how I personally prioritise this industry language. LBB> And which description do you think suits the way you work best? Laura> Strategist. I’m all about finding the really juicy insight and the right consumer problem in order to deliver on a business objective.LBB> We’re used to hearing about the best creative advertising campaigns, but what’s your favourite historic campaign from a strategic perspective? One that you feel demonstrates great strategy? Laura> Cheetos’ “can't Touch This” with MC Hammer is a favourite of mine. Cheetos was able to find a way to turn a perceived product issue (sticky orange fingers) into something meaningful. The insight is that millennials are overworked and they have to constantly feel like they are living this always on lifestyle. The slow movement and the lying flat trend are both examples of a consumer desire to be more mindful and to just do less. The message of this advertising was that sticky orange fingers are your perfect alibi to opting out for a few minutes.",Interview/Podcast

"She’s about to be 13, he’s 3. They are THE.BEST of friends. When I was pregnant with him I was so worried that the age difference would be too great. Petrified that my very serious 10 year old would not want anything to do with a sibling a decade younger than her. Boy was I wrong. So wrong. Watching their relationship blossom has been one of the highlights of these last few years. She’s fiercely protective. Loves watching him learn. Thinks he’s absolutely hilarious (because he has “her sense of humor”). And loves him so so hard. In a way I’ve never seen her love another human being.After spending the better part of a year in school virtually. She got really upset when she had to go back to school. I asked her why, assuming it had something to do with friends, being scared, bullied?!? etc. And my brave little pre-teen burst into tears, “Mom, I’m going to miss him so much”. She’s taken on a lot as Olly Olly has grown. She will help me with lunches. Make dinners occassionally. Gets him dressed. I told her last night how much I appreciated it all. And she just responded with a goofy face and “I only help because I want to”. Starting a company that was in infancy stages when the pandemic broke has been stressful. Balancing the time to be a wife, a mom and a proper boss has been a lot. But it’s simple things like her telling me she’s happy to help that make me know I’m so proud to be her mom.

"Marketing has always been about connecting people with the products and services that can enhance their lives. As technology has evolved, it’s become easier than ever to identify and reach the right audiences for your brand. But providing them with a personalized online experience can be extremely time consuming to properly execute. That’s where marketing automation can help. Marketing automation is broadly defined as a collection of software that helps eliminate repetitive tasks across channels to collect data and build more fluid engagement. Many may think of it as an email tool, but it’s actually so much more. Most marketing automation platforms integrate with social media, landing pages, chatbots, digital advertising and more to trigger cohesive and customized interactions across platforms. “According to EmailMonday, an average of 51% of companies currently employ marketing automation with more planning to adopt it in the future. It’s on the rise among B2B and B2C companies alike because it creates efficiencies, drives sales and helps nurture leads into customers,” said Star Bazella, senior vice president of digital engagement and martech strategy at Curious Plot.",LinkedIn impressions/activity
